You just spawned on stage 4 - Sundered Grove. You've got two Sale Stars in your inventory, and you know what needs to be done. Just be patient, save up a couple thousand bucks, and you'll be 2 red items richer. Piece of cake.

Of course, you can also buy a couple of other things before that, just in case, to keep yourself on pace. Grab a Mocha out of the multishop; pop a Void Cradle for a Weeping Fungus; open that small chest just to see what's insi-- FUCK!

# You just got Sale Star'd.

This silly little mod taunts you in chat when you use Sale Star suboptimally. Specifically, you are taunted when:

- Using Sale Star on a small chest when better chests exist (including the Rusted Lockbox, if you're carrying the key)
- Using Sale Star on anything other than a Legendary chest on a stage with a gauranteed Legendary Chest

This functionality is purely server-side; only the host needs the mod installed!

## Configuration

The following aspects can be configured:

- The text of the message sent in chat
- What interactibles are considered 'small chests'
- What interactibles are considered 'large chests'
- What interactibles are considered 'legendary chests'
- What stages should count as having guaranteed Legendary Chests

The configuration is editable mid-run, with all changes getting applied instantly.
